    <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p> Nothing says "weekend" like homemade pancakes for breakfast. 
            Our easy recipe will help you whip them up in less than 30 minutes. 
            Making pancake batter from scratch is so simple that you'll wonder why you 
            never did it before!</p>
    <h2>Engredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon unstalted butter</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter 
            ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, 
            whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.</p>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. 
                Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened 
                (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. 
                Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; 
                carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, 
                using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round 
                (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 
                1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until 
                browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking 
                sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. 
                Continue with more oil and remaining batter. 
                (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.</p>
